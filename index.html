            <p>
               This website is dedicated to raise awarness of head injuries within ice hockey as well as brining public attention to the disease Chronic Traumatic Encphalopathy (CTE). Hopefully through education and awarness hockey will become a more safer game encouraging more to play.

            <h1>Head Injuries and Hockey</h1>

               <p>
                  Hockey is a fast paced full contact support where injuries are frequent and expected. The evoloution of head protection in hockey has been substantial going from no helmets at all to advanced head protection desigined to reduce impact and damages taken by the head. Despite these advances, debilitating head injuries are suffered by hockey players of all skill levels every year.
                  <br>
                  According to the Minesota Department of Health boys and girls hockey has the highest rate of concussion within highschool students as seen bellow.

            As well as the NHL showing continous high rates of head injuries with numerous players get injured everyweek. The Concussion Blog a blog dedicated to head injuries from a sport's trainer perspective collects continous data pertaining to data about head injuries within sport and have aggregated this data to illustrate number of concussions within the NHL over the years.

         <h1>What is CTE?</h1>
         CTE is a degenerative brain desease that is caused through repetitive brain injury which makes it common in sports players. After sustaing multiple brain injuries a protein called Tau forms in a clump within the brain that will cause brain cell death therefore loss of material within the brain. The Tau protein is supposed to be responsible for stability in neuron structure, but through repetitive injury can cause these adverse effects. Bellow is an example of the effect CTE has on the brain.

         <h1>Symptoms and Diagnoses of CTE</h1>
         <p>
            CTE for the most part can only be tested post-mortem upon further brain examination, but new innovations have led to methods of scanning the brain for higher concentration of tau proteins to diagnose CTE on patients while still alive.
            <br>
            Symptoms of CTE can include:
            <br>
            <ul>
               <li>Mood Changes</li>
               <li>Memory Issues</li>
               <li>Impaired Judgment</li>
               <li>Dementia</li>
               <li>Aggressive Behavior</li>
               <li>Depression</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Because of these symptoms those who suffer from CTE have been victims of sucide. Stories of these victims can be seen under the Case Studies tab.
