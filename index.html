            <h1>What is CTE?</h1>
            CTE is a degenerative brain desease that is caused through repetitive brain injury which makes it common in sports players. After sustaing multiple brain injuries a protein called Tau forms in a clump within the brain that will cause brain cell death therefore loss of material within the brain. The Tau protein is supposed to be responsible for stability in neuron structure, but through repetitive injury can cause these adverse effects. Bellow is an example of the effect CTE has on the brain.
